# Affective-Computing
I.Course Description

  The  study  of systems  that  can  recognize,  interpret,  process,  and  simulate  human  affect. Topics may include physiology of emotion, lie detection, wearable devices, music, gaming, and ethical concerns associated with affective computing.

II.Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes
 
 On successful completion of the course, students should be able to:

  •Develop systems that recognize human affectsoStudents will learn how to train deep neural networks to recognize human affects from multimodal data that includes, but is not limitedto, RGB and thermal images, 3D mesh models, and physiological data.

  •Discuss philosophical, social, and ethical implications of Affective ComputingoStudents will analyze current technology that include Affective Computing such as self-driving cars, robotics, and medical applications that include teaching empathy to new physicians.

  •Read and understand state of the art literature in Affective ComputingoStudents  will  be  required  to  read  scientific  articles  on  selected  topics.  They  will answer questions related to the papers, as well as critique the pros and cons of the papers. Through this they will learn details on what makes a good scientific paper, and they will also learn the related jargon.

  •Write, scientifically, about Affective ComputingoAfter  reading  and  critiquing  state  of  the  art  papers  on  Affective  Computing, students  will  be  required  to  write  a  final  paper.  This  will  give  them  experience writing a scientific paper in the IEEE format, which is commonly used in the field of Affective Computing.
